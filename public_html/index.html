	 <h6>How to code using the <em id="riot">Riot</em> Games API for those that want to add some challenge to their lives.</h6>

	 <p>League of Legends &copy; <em id="riot">Riot</em> Games is a multi-billion dollar product/company with a huge following. The game has touched many people all over the world over its relatively short life, being just 7 years old at the time of writing (including beta-testing). As such, many people, whether they just enjoy the game or are looking to dabble in application development, may have an interest in furthering their involvement with the game. Short of becoming an employee of <em id="riot">Riot</em>, online application development is the fastest way to find one's way to this further involvement. This document was constructed for that person, in an attempt to introduce as many as possible to the world of web development using an Application Program Interface (API). However, beware. These instructions assume that the reader has at least rudimentary knowledge of JavaScript, and access to a server to host their application on.</p>
