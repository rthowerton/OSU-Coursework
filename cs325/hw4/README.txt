Compile my submission by running "g++ act.cpp".

Run it by typing "a.out" in the same directory as a file called act.txt
which should be formatted as a number of test cases where each test case
is prefixed with a line containing a single number equal to the number
of lines of activities in the test case.

Each activity should be formatted as 
X Y Z
where X is the numerical identifier for the activity, Y is the start
time of the activity, and Z is the finishing time for the activity.

The code will output the number of the test case, how many activities
from each test case were scheduled, and the numerical identifier (in
order of start time) of each scheduled activity.
