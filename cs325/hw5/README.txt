Contained is my submission for CS325 Assignment 5.

The zip file contains this README file, and a c++ file called wrestler.cpp. To compile
wrestler.cpp, simply enter <g++ wrestler.cpp>

To run the code, enter <a.out [input file name]> and observe the output. The input file
should be formatted as follows:
X
[name1]
[name2]
  ...  
[nameX]
Y
[rivalry1]
[rivalry2]
   ...   
[rivalryY]
where X and Y are both integer numbers, name1..nameX are single words, and rivalry1..rivalryY
are pairs of words and each word is in name1..nameX.
