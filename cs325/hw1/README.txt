To run any of the included programs, compile them using g++ [program name], and be sure to have prepared a file called data.txt in the same directory that contains one or more lines of numbers separated by spaces, where the first number is equal to the number of other numbers on that line. Once the program is compiled, simply type a.out and hit enter. Once it has finished running, you can use either cat or view the document (insert.out for insertion sort; merge.out for merge sort) to check the results.
