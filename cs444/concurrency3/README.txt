This bz2 file contains the two problems used in Concurrency 3 for CS444 at
Oregon State University. To build both of these solutions, simply enter
make. This will produce executables for both problems 1 and 2. Problem1
has the usage of problem1 # (where # is the number of threads you wish to
generate). Problem2 has the usage of problem2 a b c (where a is the number
of searchers, b is the number of inserters, and c is the number of
deleters). When you are finished, you can delete the executables by
running make clean.
