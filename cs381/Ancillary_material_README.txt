ONCE UPON AN ALGORITHM -- ANCILLARY MATERIAL


The ancillary material for the book consists of code and teaching material for introductory computer science classes and will be released in several steps over
a period of time.


>>> CODE

The chapters of the book are accompanied by Haskell code examples that reflect
the examples in the book. The purpose of the code is to illustrate how the
concepts of computer science introduced in the book can be realized in a
programming language. Currently, a version in Haskell is under development. At a
later time a Python version might follow.

The code is further accompanied by a guide that provides a brief introduction to
some basic elements of Haskell and then explains the code and how it relates to
the examples in the book. The code guide also provides exercises with solutions.

The code plus its guide is freely available to the public. It will be released
in several steps over the coming months. The first five chapters are available
beginning of September 2017.
